The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write. Example usage to set ERC-1967 implementation slot: ```solidity contract ERC1967 {     // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;     }     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {         require(newImplementation.code.length > 0);         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;     } } ``` TIP: Consider using this library along with {SlotDerivation}.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":\"StorageSlot\"},\"evmVersion\":\"prague\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\":@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/\",\":erc4626-tests/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/lib/erc4626-tests/\",\":forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\",\":halmos-cheatcodes/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/lib/halmos-cheatcodes/src/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\"]},\"sources\":{\"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xcf74f855663ce2ae00ed8352666b7935f6cddea2932fdf2c3ecd30a9b1cd0e97\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://9f660b1f351b757dfe01438e59888f31f33ded3afcf5cb5b0d9bf9aa6f320a8b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmarDJ5hZEgBtCmmrVzEZWjub9769eD686jmzb2XpSU1cM\"]}},\"version\":1}","userdoc":{},"devdoc":{},"evm":{"bytecode":{"object":"6055604b600b8282823980515f1a607314603f577f4e487b71000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005f525f60045260245ffd5b305f52607381538281f3fe730000000000000000000000000000000000000000301460806040525f5ffdfea26469706673582212206c04a57a8408e5c3136f30bed59fb78e631777798f9b5b263c1db27e382fade364736f6c634300081e0033","sourceMap":"1407:2774:12:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;","linkReferences":{}},"deployedBytecode":{"object":"730000000000000000000000000000000000000000301460806040525f5ffdfea26469706673582212206c04a57a8408e5c3136f30bed59fb78e631777798f9b5b263c1db27e382fade364736f6c634300081e0033","sourceMap":"1407:2774:12:-:0;;;;;;;;","linkReferences":{}}}}},"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol":{"IERC165":{"abi":[{"type":"function","name":"supportsInterface","inputs":[{"name":"interfaceId","type":"bytes4","internalType":"bytes4"}],"outputs":[{"name":"","type":"bool","internalType":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"view"}],"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.30+commit.73712a01\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes4\",\"name\":\"interfaceId\",\"type\":\"bytes4\"}],\"name\":\"supportsInterface\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bool\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"bool\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Interface of the ERC-165 standard, as defined in the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC].

@dev Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.\n Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {nonReentrant} modifier\n available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested\n (reentrant) calls to them.\n Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as\n `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul].\n IMPORTANT: Deprecated. This storage-based reentrancy guard will be removed and replaced\n by the {ReentrancyGuardTransient} variant in v6.0.\n
